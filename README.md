# neovim

I did this inspired by [How to create your own Neovim flake](https://primamateria.github.io/blog/neovim-nix). To run [install nix](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer#the-determinate-nix-installer) and then do
```
nix run github:rigille/neovim
```
No need to clone this repository. Also don't worry, you can uninstall without leaving any trace in your system.
